MySQL provides connectivity for client applications developed in .NET compatible programming languages with Connector/NET.

MySQL Connector/NET is a library compatible with .NET Framework and .NET Core, for specific versions see [MySQL Connector/NET Versions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-versions.html). The driver is a pure C# implementation of the MySQL protocol and does not rely on the MySQL client library.

From MySQL Connector/NET 8.0, the driver also contains an implementation of [MySQL X DevAPI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/), an Application Programming Interface for working with [MySQL as a Document Store](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/document-store.html) through CRUD-based, NoSQL operations.

From MySQL Connector/NET 8.1, the driver contains an implementation of [OpenTelemetry](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-programming-telemetry.html) which requires the use of the [MySql.Data.OpenTelemetry](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data.OpenTelemetry/) Nuget package to enable the generation of telemetry data.

From MySQL Connector/NET 8.2, the driver adds support for [WebAuthn authentication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/connector-net/latest/api/data_api/MySql.Data.MySqlClient.WebAuthnActionCallback.html), the driver also adds support for [.NET 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8/).

From MySQL Connector/NET 8.3, the driver also adds support for [.NET 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8/) and [EFCore 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-8.0/whatsnew/) GA versions.

From MySQL Connector/NET 8.4, the driver adds support for TLS1.3 and removes support for FIDO authentication plugin.

From MySQL Connector/NET 9.0, the driver removes support for .NET 7 and EF Core 7.

From MySQL Connector/NET 9.1, the driver adds support for [.NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview/) and [EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew/) preview versions.

From MySQL Connector/NET 9.2, the driver adds support for [.NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview/) and [EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew/) GA versions.

From MySQL Connector/NET 9.2, the driver removes support for .NET 6 and EF Core 6.

From MySQL Connector/NET 9.3, the driver adds fixes to test suite and support for newest versions of EF Core 8 and EF Core 9.
